#### A plact to meet on the internet

This is a generic example of using winsock and WebRTC.  Websockets are used to create a multi-person chat area.  There is an option to use WebRTC to create a peer to peer connection with audio / video along with a direct data pipeline.

This is the UI side of the project.  The server side is in another repo. (pending link).

This is for demo purposes, not for production use.  

### Usage
This is designed to be used with the Mongino server development, hosting and deployment environment.  That said, the code in this repo does all the key stuff for websocket and WebRTC interaction.
